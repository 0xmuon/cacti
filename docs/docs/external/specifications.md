The Weaver specifications ([RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/tree/main/interop-rfcs)) capture abstractions, models, protocols and data formats for enabling cross-ledger communication. 

For newcomers we recommend starting with the protocol overview document followed by the RFCs on models. Protocol engineers will find in [RFC: 01-007](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/blob/main/interop-rfcs/models/relays.md) a useful overview of the relay model, and may then progress on to reading one of the existing protocols' design and implementation; e.g., the data transfer protocol in [RFC: 02-002](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/blob/main/interop-rfcs/protocols/data-transfer/readme.md). If you are interested in adding support for a new ledger technology, see implementing a new driver and implementing interoperability modules for your ledger technology. Where relevant we use ABNF for formal syntax definitions.
