# IIN Agent Implementation

In this folder lies an implementation of the core, or common, part of an IIN agent according to the [RFC specification](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/blob/main/rfcs/models/identity/iin-agent.md). This module is built in a DLT-neutral manner and can be used by a participant of a network running on any DLT platform.
